## Overview

Privducai (Privacy + Education + AI) is a native macOS application that provides a DuckDuckGo assistant experience similar to Perplexica, but optimized for Apple Silicon Macs. It combines efficient web search with on-device AI summarization to help you find and understand information quickly without draining your battery.

### How It Works

1. **Search**: Enter your query in the search bar
2. **Fetch**: The app queries DuckDuckGo and retrieves top results
3. **Summarize**: Apple's NaturalLanguage framework analyzes the results
4. **Present**: Get a concise summary with links to full sources

## Technical Details

### Power Efficiency

- **URLSession Configuration**: Optimized for low power consumption
- **Request Caching**: Reduces redundant network requests
- **Limited Results**: Fetches only top 10 results per query
- **On-Device Processing**: No external API calls for AI processing

### AI Summarization

The app uses Apple's NaturalLanguage framework instead of cloud-based LLMs:
- **NLTokenizer**: Sentence segmentation
- **NLTagger**: Part-of-speech tagging and key term extraction
- **Relevance Scoring**: Custom algorithm to identify most relevant sentences
- **Extractive Summarization**: Selects key information from search results

### Privacy

- Uses DuckDuckGo's privacy-focused search
- All AI processing happens on-device
- No user data collection or tracking
- No external API calls for language processing
